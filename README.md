# Products
The auxiliary repository, used by VirtualShip, to retrieve information on how to download a product. See https://github.com/VirtualShip/Core to learn more!

## How does VirtualShip use this repo?
This repo acts as a source on the cloud so that later on, when more and more products and stock scripts get added, update and download times will stay consistent. It's one of our basic ways to keep one of our 3 S's: Speed!
